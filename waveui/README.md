# Waveui

Waveui is a modular flutter ui library focused on **efficiency**, **customization**, and **modern design standards**. It provides rich, reusable widgets that make building complex apps easier and faster.

## Our Mission

- Provide **efficient**, **beautiful**, and **highly customizable** widgets  
- Align with **modern community and design standards**  
- Continuously evolve to support the **widest range of components possible**  
- Deliver a **developer friendly API**

>⚠️ Please **do not use in production** unless you're an **active contributor**.  
> The public API is under **rapid iteration** and breaking changes are expected without notice.


## Installation & Usage

Install via pub:

```sh
flutter pub add waveui
````

Wrap your app with `WaveApp` to enable global theming:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  builder: (context, child) => WaveApp(
    theme: Theme.of(context), // or a custom theme
    child: child!,
  ),
);
```
